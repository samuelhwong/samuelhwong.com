Once upon a time, a young man living in Toronto faced an agonizingly difficult decision. You see, he was about to graduate from high school and he needed to decide what to study in university. His marks were top notch - honest! - so he had his pick of schools and programs. But it just wasn't clear which programs would be the best fit.

> Which engineering discipline should he choose?

Having done extremely well in the maths and sciences, the young man had a naturally bent towards engineering. But which engineering discipline should he choose? Shall he build bridges or cars, or design CPUs or the factories that build them?

At the same time, he also enjoyed tinkering with computers. His interest in computers was due in no small part to his father, who regularly brought home all sorts of esoteric networking equipment. Hence, Computer Science was also an attractive option. 

Undecided, the young man at last chose Engineering Science at the University of Toronto. It was touted as a challenging and stimulating program, and best of all, it enabled him to enjoy two years of broad study before being forced to specialize. Procrastination win!

Upon his third year of study, the young man chose to specialize in aerospace engineering. "I wanted to be cool and unique", he said. "Besides, girls dig guys who know how to put them over the moon." So off he went, thinking that while "finding love" isn't rocket science, but it probably helps to be a rocket scientist.

To no surprise, the young man's favourite course was Scientific Computing, which is the discipline of building computer algorithms to solve mathematical equations. And so, at the end of his undergraduate studies, the young man applied for graduate school at the Institute for Aerospace Studies, to further pursue his dual passions of computers and engineering. 

Graduate school turned out to be one of the most challenging endeavours the young man had ever taken on. As it turns out, developing computer algorithms to solve mathematical equations that modelled the gases swirling inside of a burning rocket engine isn't so easy.

After switching research topics, working part-time in an abandoned military base, and growing some GRIT (Ginormous Resilience and Inner persisTence), the young man finally completed his [thesis]({{ site.url }}/assets/thesis.pdf) and graduated with a Masters of Applied Science in Computational Fluid Dynamics. Whew!

By this time, the young man wanted to rest his newly acquired GRIT. Still pursuing his first love, he headed towards a career in the software development industry, trying his hand at everything from web to backend to mobile, from startup to corporate enterprise. 

The story of the young man and his love of software continues today. Perhaps he's a little less young now, and a little wiser, too. However his story unfolds, he's sure of one thing: He might not be working on rockets anymore, but it certainly helps to be a rocket scientist.
