I'm Sam. I'm a software engineer living in Markham, Canada.
I have <s>an obsession</s> a passion for using technology to make the world
just a bit better.

By day, I'm an Applications Specialist at Bell Canada. The job title
doesn't tell you much, but if you follow me around, you'll
see me managing computing infrastructure, troubleshooting network packets,
designing APIs, and getting my hands dirty writing and reviewing code.

Outside the office, I'm a father and husband and a geeky bookworm.
I'm curently reading [Looptail](http://looptail.com/)
and [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.ca/Code-Complete-2nd-Steve-McConnell/dp/0735619670)
on my Kindle.

In an another life, [I was a rocket scientist](/yes-im-a-rocket-scientist).

I’m always interested in hearing from others who are also passionate about software,
so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect!
